    <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Project</h1>
            <h1>Context</h1>
            <p>Our class was assigned to make a movie-based project with our assigned partners, we had to rely on using the basics of HTML and CSS from what we learned to design our own genre of a movie film. My partner and I decided to make a horror movie called "Grim Trick". </p>
            <p>First, my partner and I planned out the list of things that we had to include in this project. This way we didn't have to tap between different tabs. Once, we list the things we needed to include, my partner and I focused on individual works based on the spilt of HTML and CSS. This is significant since we both got to learn HTML and CSS effectively without giving entirely the HTML to one person and CSS to the other. In addition to effective collaboration, we helped each other by doing the some of the task together, this allowed the add on of knowledge which we both had different ideas to make our project stand out more.  </p>
            <h1>Content</h1>
            <h3>For HTML:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Headings</li>
                <li>Paragraphs</li>
                <li>Div and Span</li>
                <li>Import embed code for google font</li>
                <li>2 Local images</li>
                <li>Input and Submit button</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For CSS:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Include element, class, and id selectors</li>
                <li>Border-style property</li>
                <li>Padding and Margin properties</li>
                <li>Font-family property</li>
                <li>Background-color property</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Challenge:</h1>
            <p>Though, the movie was fairly short, I wanted my audience to know that the movie is only part of a showcase. I planned to make a sequel HTML, but then we ran out of time, my partner and I wasn't able to fully finish the storyline of the movie since we kept switching our original draft in the planner to make the story flow out more clearly.</p>
            <h1>Takeaway:</h1>
            <p>Our movie focused a lot on CSS and the different kinds of property we could use to make our story stand out more vibrately. For example, instead of one color background, we wanted a multi-color background which allowed the mixing of multiple different colors that flow as the storyline progresses. To which my partner and I used google to search up for a property that allowed us to have multiple colors and color maker to portray a random generated color that fit our theme to which we could then input it onto our background.</p>
        <div>
            ```background: linear-gradient(color1, color2, color3, ...)```
        </div>
            <h1>Next Steps:</h1>
            <p>If I had more time to complete the storyline, I would definitely make a sequel to the movie. However as of now, the initial thought process could be that the movie is to be a trailer to the movie of "Grim Trick"  that has yet been fully released to our public viewers which makes our audience more curious about how the story will continue to end up to.</p>
            <h1>Skills:</h1>
            <p>The skills that I've learned from this project is collaboration and communication. When I communicate with my partner, we were able to get the work done more efficiently since we were able to navigate between the things that we have done and discuss the missing components of the webpage. This meant that we were more prepared to include the components that were necessary for the project and futhermore add other components to make our webpage look asethetic. The door of communication led to the path of collaboration since my partner and I learned from communicating with each other through from struggling to understanding the code. With each other's notes, we were able to share what we had and what we knew to allow both of us to help each other which leads to more progress and effort of collaboration throughout our time of working through the project given in class.</p>
