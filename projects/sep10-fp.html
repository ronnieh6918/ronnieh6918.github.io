            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The Freedom Project is my final project in my sophomore year, I designed a website based on the chosen topic I selected which was Security and Investigation. The layout of this project requires a lot of research on pre-existing technologies revolving around existing softwares and hardwares, while also included brainstorming of possible future technologies. My goal for this project is to divert more people who might be interest or intruiged into the field of Security and Investigation. </p>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>My website has these selections: Context, Part A: Existing Softwares and Hardwares, and Part B: Future Technologies. My Freedom Project website consists of bootstrap components such as navbar, carousel, and cards. I was also able to learn my tool which was A-Frame and create models for my future technologies. Along with Bootstrap and A-Frame, a lot of the content in the website is from HTML and styling with CSS which we learned throughout SEP 10.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>For my freedom project website, there was a lot of problems with my website based on the feedbacks of my peers. Especially when it comes to improving the overall responsiveness of your website, but also improving bootstrap cards so that all of the cards look equal in height compared to others. </p>

            <p>Diving into one of the problems I had with my website, the responsiveness helps improve users on different screen device to view the information more effectively. This comes when arranging text inside of a column or even images in your website. For my website, I had a lot of issues with using media queries to improve the responsiveness of my website, so I used an alternative from bootstrap's grid system and assigning a col classes to adjust how much you want certain column to take up on an assigned screen size. Some of my text were overlapping the images on medium screen devices, and to fix this, I had to adjust how much the image and text took. Hence, I used ``col-md-8`` for image meaning the image on medium screen devices will take up 2/3 of the viewport. Meanwhile, I made the text take up less space which is the remaining 1/3 on medium screen devices by assigning ``col-md-4``. </p>

            <p>Another challenge I faced with my website is how to make all of my cards match the same in terms of height. This is because a type of bootstrap card that I used for my freedom project had a image and a text. In some cases, I have more text or a bigger image making it so that the card stretches out further, which ultimately affect the height of the website. One of my peers recommended me to use flexbox, and so I was able to learn a bit of flexbox and use it to make my cards all have the same height regardless of the amount of text or how big the image is compared to others. I did this by using ``display: flex;`` which made the text align inside a card, ``flex-direction: column`` which made every card stack vertically, and ``height: 100%;`` which made all of my card's height stretch up the same percentage to make every card have a height that match with one another.

            <p>Some takeaways for my website is that my website was able to significantly improve with the recommendation of my peers, especially when I felt like everything was enough, their recommendation only driven me to keep going to improve my freedom project to what it looks now. Another takeaway is making sure that I follow my wireframe first before adding any changes because it's always better to start the foundation of your website's layout before making any adjustment, so this way time is conserved and you'd have more time to brainstorm what changes you want later on. </p>

            <br>
            <p>My wireframe helped me format my website's layout. After I made my website look identical to my wireframe on both mobile and desktop, I was also able to add more onto my website with bootstrap components and putting more time into improving the design of my website which now my freedom project website would look better compared to my starting wireframe. Hence, wireframes is a good starting point in organizing the foundation of your website before adding more onto your website once your website matched your wireframe.</p>
